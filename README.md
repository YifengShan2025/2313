# Advancing Named Entity Recognition in Interprofessional Collaboration and Education

## 📘 Overview

This project aims to advance the performance and application of **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in the context of **Interprofessional Collaboration and Education (IPCE)**. It addresses the unique linguistic challenges found in interdisciplinary communications—such as those between healthcare providers, educators, and researchers—by developing domain-adapted NER models and tools.

By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP architectures and specialized corpora, this project seeks to identify and classify named entities (e.g., roles, disciplines, interventions, organizations) in clinical and educational texts, thereby enhancing information extraction, role recognition, and workflow analysis across interprofessional settings.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop robust NER models fine-tuned for IPCE corpora.
- Annotate domain-specific datasets using a customized entity taxonomy.
- Evaluate model performance on healthcare and education-related datasets.
- Deploy tools for visualizing and integrating NER results into collaborative workflows.
